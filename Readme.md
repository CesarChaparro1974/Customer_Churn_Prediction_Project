# Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning
## Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will churn (leave their telecommunications provider) using a set of 19 features and a target variable churn. The dataset includes a variety of customer metrics such as account information, call usage data, and service plans. The goal is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a customer will churn based on these features.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of 4,250 samples, each containing the following 19 features and a target variable churn:

state: State code of customer residence.
account_length: Number of months the customer has been with the current telco provider.
area_code: 3-digit area code.
international_plan: Whether the customer has an international plan.
voice_mail_plan: Whether the customer has a voicemail plan.
number_vmail_messages: Number of voicemail messages.
total_day_minutes: Total minutes of day calls.
total_day_calls: Total day calls.
total_day_charge: Total charge for day calls.
total_eve_minutes: Total minutes of evening calls.
total_eve_calls: Total evening calls.
total_eve_charge: Total charge for evening calls.
total_night_minutes: Total minutes of night calls.
total_night_calls: Total night calls.
total_night_charge: Total charge for night calls.
total_intl_minutes: Total minutes of international calls.
total_intl_calls: Total international calls.
total_intl_charge: Total charge for international calls.
number_customer_service_calls: Number of calls to customer service.
churn: Whether the customer has churned (target variable).
## Steps to Build the Model
### Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
Normalize numerical features.
### Model Selection:

Choose a machine learning algorithm (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train the model on the training data.
### Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
### Model Optimization:

Fine-tune the model using hyperparameter optimization.
### Prediction and Submission:

Use the model to predict customer churn.
Submit the predictions.
### Results
The modelâ€™s accuracy will be assessed using test data and the results will be compared against the expected outcomes.

## Conclusion
The final model will help predict customer churn, which can inform business strategies aimed at retaining valuable customers.
